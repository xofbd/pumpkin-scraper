If you have GNU Make and Poetry installed, you can install the project via `make install`. If you don't have Poetry and GNU Make, you can create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) using the `requirements.txt` file. For example:

* `python3 -m venv venv`
* `source venv/bin/activate` or `venv\Scripts\activate` in Windows
